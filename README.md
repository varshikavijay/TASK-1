# PRODIGY_ML_01
ML Internship at [Prodigy InfoTech](https://prodigyinfotech.dev) 

The repository has code which works on the linear regression modle to estimate and cote the value of houses by considering the square footage and the number of bedroom and bathroom by the dataset given by kaggle house pricing competion

## Description
Managing the acutal problems which occurs, and coating the most relaibe cost is the major issue. By using machine learning this proble can be handled in a more easier and relaible manner with the regression techniques coded on thenm.
The objective of this linear regression is to analyze the given dataset and creat the most prcise model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Housing Prices Competition dataset from Kaggle.this dataset contain both Testing and Training data.

## Techniques
The following techniques used in this project:

 - Linear Regression
- correlation graph
